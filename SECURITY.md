# Security & Production Readiness

## Security Implementations

### 1. ✅ Secure Debug Default

- Changed `DEBUG` default from `True` to `False` in settings
- Production settings enforce `DEBUG=False`

### 2. ✅ Python Security Scanning

- Installed `safety` tool for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Run regularly: `.venv/bin/safety check`

### 3. ✅ Strong Secret Generation

- Created `scripts/generate-secrets.py` to generate cryptographically strong secrets
- Generates 50+ character secrets for Django, JWT, HMAC, and encryption keys
- Run: `python scripts/generate-secrets.py`

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Webhook Security

- Implemented HMAC-SHA256 signature validation in `webhooks/webhook_receiver.py`
- Timestamp validation with 5-minute tolerance to prevent replay attacks
- Security logging for webhook validation attempts
- Rate limiting per webhook to prevent abuse

## Security Checklist

Run the security audit: `bash scripts/security-check.sh`

### Pre-Production Requirements

- [ ] **Secrets Management**
  - [ ] Generate production secrets using `scripts/generate-secrets.py`
  - [ ] Store secrets in secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
  - [ ] Never commit secrets to version control
  - [ ] Rotate secrets annually

- [ ] **Environment Configuration**
  - [ ] Set `DEBUG=False` in production
  - [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with actual domain names
  - [ ] Set up HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
  - [ ] Configure secure CORS origins
  - [ ] Enable HSTS headers

- [ ] **Database Security**
  - [ ] Use strong database passwords (24+ characters)
  - [ ] Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
  - [ ] Configure database backups with encryption
  - [ ] Restrict database access by IP

- [ ] **Application Security**
  - [ ] Enable CSRF protection (already enabled by Django)
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
  - [ ] Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - [ ] Configure secure cookie settings
  - [ ] Implement session timeout

- [ ] **Infrastructure Security**
  - [ ] Use EU-based infrastructure (GDPR compliance)
  - [ ] Enable firewall rules
  - [ ] Set up intrusion detection
  - [ ] Configure DDoS protection
  - [ ] Enable audit logging

- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**
  - [ ] Set up security event monitoring
  - [ ] Configure alerts for failed authentication attempts
  - [ ] Monitor for unusual webhook activity
  - [ ] Track API rate limit violations
  - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

## Webhook Security

### HMAC Signature Validation

All incoming webhooks must include:

- `X-Webhook-Signature`: HMAC-SHA256 signature
- `X-Webhook-Timestamp`: Unix timestamp (within 5 minutes)

Signature calculation:

```
signature = HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + request_body)
```

### Rate Limiting

Webhooks are rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per webhook ID.

## Security Headers

Production settings include:

```python
# HTTPS enforcement
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True

# Security headers
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'
```

## Regular Security Tasks

### Daily

- Monitor security alerts
- Review failed authentication logs
- Check webhook validation failures

### Weekly

- Run dependency vulnerability scans
- Review access logs
- Update security patches

### Monthly

- Security audit with `scripts/security-check.sh`
- Review and update firewall rules
- Test backup restoration

### Quarterly

- Penetration testing
- Security training for team
- Review and update security policies

### Annually

- Rotate all secrets
- Full security audit
- Update security documentation

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Monitor alerts and logs
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Remove threat
4. **Recovery**: Restore services
5. **Post-Incident**: Document and improve
