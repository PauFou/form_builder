- Path traversal prevention
- LDAP injection prevention (placeholder)

#### Concurrency (placeholders)

- Race condition in registration
- Token refresh race condition

### ❌ Failing Tests (5/48)

1. **JWT Replay Attack Prevention**
   - Issue: Token blacklisting not fully implemented
   - The logout endpoint returns 400 when trying to blacklist tokens

2. **Rate Limiting Tests (3 tests)**
   - Login rate limiting by IP
   - Password reset rate limiting
   - Registration rate limiting
   - Issue: django-ratelimit decorators not working in test environment

3. **Password Strength Validation**
   - Issue: Django's default password validators don't enforce all requirements
   - Need custom validator for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters

## Security Findings

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Rate limiting decorators are present but not properly configured
   - Need to ensure rate limiting works in production

2. **Weak Password Policy**
   - Current implementation accepts weak passwords
   - Need to implement custom password validators

3. **Token Blacklisting Issues**
   - JWT token blacklisting not working properly
   - Could allow replay attacks

### Security Features Working Correctly

1. **JWT Token Security**
   - Proper expiration times (1h access, 7d refresh)
   - Signature validation working
   - Modified tokens are rejected

2. **Multi-Organization Isolation**
   - JWT tokens don't contain organization-specific claims
   - Proper permission checks in place

3. **Email Security**
   - Email enumeration prevention working
   - Timing attacks mitigated
   - Verification tokens expire and are single-use

4. **Input Validation**
   - SQL injection attempts blocked
   - XSS payloads handled safely
   - Path traversal prevented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Token Blacklisting**

   ```python
   # Ensure INSTALLED_APPS includes:
   'rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist',

   # Run migrations:
   python manage.py migrate token_blacklist
   ```

2. **Implement Custom Password Validator**

   ```python
   class StrongPasswordValidator:
       def validate(self, password, user=None):
           # Check for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars
           # Minimum length 12 characters
           # No common passwords
   ```

3. **Configure Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   # Use django-ratelimit or implement custom middleware
   # Set appropriate limits for:
   # - Login: 5/minute per IP, 10/hour per email
   # - Registration: 3/hour per IP
   # - Password reset: 3/hour per IP, 3/day per email
   ```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Implement 2FA**
   - TOTP support
   - Backup codes
   - SMS fallback (with security considerations)

2. **Add Security Monitoring**
   - Failed login attempt logging
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

3. **Enhance HMAC Security**
   - Add replay protection with nonces
   - Implement request signing for all sensitive endpoints

4. **Add OAuth Providers**
   - Google OAuth with proper validation
   - PKCE flow for security
   - State parameter validation

## Test Execution

To run the security tests:

```bash
# With SQLite (for local testing)
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings_test_sqlite python -m pytest core/tests/test_auth_security.py -v

# With PostgreSQL (requires database permissions)
python -m pytest core/tests/test_auth_security.py -v
```

## Conclusion

The authentication system has good security foundations but needs improvements in:

- Rate limiting implementation
- Password strength enforcement
- Token blacklisting functionality

Most security best practices are followed, but the identified issues should be addressed before production deployment.
