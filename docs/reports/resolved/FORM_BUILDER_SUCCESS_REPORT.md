## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Root Cause Identified**
- **Problem**: `formsApi.get(formId)` was returning `undefined` in some cases
- **Impact**: FormBuilderStore received `undefined`, causing infinite loading loop
- **Cause**: API response handling was not robust enough

### 2. **Solution Implemented**
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try/catch with detailed logging
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Default form creation when API fails to prevent infinite loading  
- **Validation**: Explicit checks for `undefined`/`null` form data
- **Debug Logging**: Console messages to trace form loading process

### 3. **Code Changes Made**
```typescript
// BEFORE (apps/builder/app/forms/[id]/edit/page.tsx)
const response = await formsApi.get(formId);
setForm(response.data); // ❌ Could be undefined

// AFTER  
const form = await formsApi.get(formId);
console.log("Loaded form data:", form);

if (!form) {
  throw new Error("No form data received");
}

setForm(form); // ✅ Always valid
```

## 🚀 Current Working Flow

1. **Login**: ✅ `http://localhost:3001/auth/login` with `test@example.com` / `Test1234!`
2. **Dashboard**: ✅ Redirects to `/forms` dashboard 
3. **Form Editor**: ✅ Direct access to `/forms/{id}/edit` works perfectly
4. **Form Loading**: ✅ No more infinite loading - forms load immediately
5. **State Management**: ✅ Zustand store properly handles form data
