# ðŸš€ Form Builder Platform - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a detailed, production-ready implementation plan for the Form Builder platform. Each phase is designed to deliver working features that pass CI/CD and are ready for production deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

1. **Production-First**: Every feature must be production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and monitoring
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests first, ensure GitHub Actions pass before moving forward
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship small, working increments frequently
4. **Performance Budget**: Respect bundle size (<30KB) and performance metrics (TTFB <200ms)
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance is non-negotiable
6. **Security**: OWASP Top 10 compliance, proper auth, input validation
