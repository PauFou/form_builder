## 📍 Conclusion

The form builder platform has a solid foundation with excellent architecture and modern tech choices. The core functionality is largely complete, but the project needs stabilization, testing improvements, and production hardening before it's ready for launch.

**Estimated time to production:** 6-8 weeks with proper resources

**Risk level:** Medium - Main risks are around testing stability and production readiness

**Recommendation:** Focus on stabilization and testing before adding new features
